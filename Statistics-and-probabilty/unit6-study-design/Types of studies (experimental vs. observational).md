### worked example identifying experiment

The taste engineers at “Drinksoft” have developed a new formula for their major brand “Cola-Loca.” They wanted to know how tasty it is to teenagers compared to the old formula, so they decided to set up a blind taste test.

They randomly assigned \[300\] blindfolded, teenaged participants to two groups. One group was given the old formula of “Cola-Loca,” and the other was given the new formula. Each participant was asked to fill a formal taste \[10\]-point questionnaire, where \[1\] is considered "awful" and \[10\] is considered "delicious."
