 Introduction to experiment design. Explanatory and response variables. Control and treatment groups.

### The language of experiments

 **What is the explanatory variable?** 

 An explanatory variable explains changes in another variable. 

 **What is the response variable?** 

 A response variable measures the result of a study.  

 **What are the treatments?** 

 A treatment is the specific level of the explanatory variable given to individuals in an experiment.  

 **Who or what are the experimental units?** 

 An experimental unit is who or what we are assigning to a treatment. 

### The principles of experiment design

 A comparative experiment involves one group receiving a treatment (the insoles) and another group that doesn't receive the treatment. 

 Random assignment 

 **This design might lead to confounding because a difference between the two groups could be due to the placebo effect.** 

 **A double-blind design protects against some possible sources of bias.**

| random assignment    | Can determine causal relationship in population. this design is relatively rare in the real world. | Can determine causal relationship in that sample only. This design is where most experiments would fit. |
| No random assignment | Can detect relationships in population, but cannot determine causality. This design is where many surveys and observational studies would fit. | Can detect relationships in that sample only, but cannot determine causality. This design is where many unscientific surveys and polls would fit. |
